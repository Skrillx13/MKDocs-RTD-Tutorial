# Welcome to the MKDocs-RTD-Tutorial

Documentation that aims to guide users through a standard way of creating Documentation using [MKDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org), and then consequently published to ReadTheDocs, so that itâ€™s made available to whoever needs to read it.

!!! note
    
    There is a sister project for this, the [Spinx-RTD-Tutorial](https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). If you are looking for something involving Spinx and ReadTheDocs, that website is what you are looking for.

**In-depth and simple**

Simple explanations about the way MKDocs works with RTD, allowing for easier user access without a sharp learning curve.

**Open Source**

Documentation built for the community, meaning anyone is welcome to contribute. Simply make a pull request, and propose your changes. 

**Everything is free**

Everything showcased here can be easily obtained for free, even the hosting. Paid alternatives are also available, but the free ones will work just fine.

If any help is required, you can look at this Documentation's Repository, and look at base code for examples. Don't steal code though.
