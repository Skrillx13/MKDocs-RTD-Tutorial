# Welcome to the MKDocs-RTD-Tutorial

Documentation that aims to guide users through a standard way of creating Documentation using [MKDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org), and then consequently published to ReadTheDocs, so that itâ€™s made available to whoever needs to read it.

!!! note
    
    There is a sister project for this, the [Spinx-RTD-Tutorial](https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). If you are looking for something involving Spinx, that website is what you are looking for.

**In-depth and simple**

Simple explanations about the way MKDocs worms with RTD, allowing for easier user access without a sharp learning curve.

**Open Source**

Documentation built for the community, meaning anyone is welcome to contribute. Simply make a pull request, and propose your changes. 

**Everything is free**

Everything showcased here can be easily obtained for free, even the hosting. Paid alternatives are also available, but the free ones will work just fine.
